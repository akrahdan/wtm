                                Thanks a lot for these lessons. They are an eye opener. My question is do you have these lessons in the form of a book (either hard copy or soft copy for future use). If you have, how can I access those books

                                 I have a request. Im asking for old lessons to put them in a book because soon I will be going back to Zambia. I lost that phone. This time I want to be writing the studies to go and share with others who dont have access on WhatsApp. I have enough time to write all the topics in a book.

                                Good morning. All the studies we've done so far do you have a book for it. I want to do regular studies on them so I can also share with others. How much is the book?

                 <p>Friends, these calls for publication and many other testimonies of how the Lord is changing and enriching lives through our Bible studies have given us the courage to move ahead with our plans to publish our materials into books. Our series of Bible study that are ready for publication include:</p>

                 <ol>
                     <li>The Final Events of Bible Prophecy</li>

                     <li>The Rapture and the Second Coming of Christ</li>
                     <li>Heaven</li>
                     <li>The Truth About Death</li>

                     <li>
                         The Truth About Hell
                     </li>


                 </ol>

                <p>The study material that we are featuring now for publication is The Final Events of Bible Prophecy. Upon consultation with a US printing firm, we have arrived at an estimate of $31,629.75 for the first 5,000 copies of the book.</p>
                <p>Friends, we want to saturate the globe with these Bible studies that are making a lot of impact. But if we can do that, we definitely need your financial support. No amount is too large as this project is going to cost several thousands of dollars. However, we have estimated that if we can get 2,000 people with each person offering us a suggested donation of 15 dollars or more, we will be able to raise the initial amount to pay for the first 5,000 copies of the Bible Prophecy Book. If you donate at least 15 dollars to this cause, you are really strengthening our hands to begin working on publishing our Bible prophecy material as well as other topics in the WTM series of Bible study. </p>
                <p>WTM will ship or post a copy of the published prophecy book to each donor. The book is going to be of a high quality standard which includes perfect binding with about 24 full paged colour pictures inserted at appropriate pages to enable readers to come away with a clear understanding of the Bible prophecy issues that are being presented. If you've been blessed through this ministry, we encourage you to prayerfully consider partnering with us in this important endeavour so we can reach a larger audience with the everlasting gospel of Jesus.</p>
                <p>Please donate now! And when you donate, don't forget to send us your name and mailing address through our email donations@whitethroneministries.org or the WhatsApp numbers: +233243105287 or +233509834815.  Providing your details to us through these two mediums will enable us to ship or post a copy of the prophecy book to you when it is ready. You are also welcome to speak with us if you want to invest in our publications. If you want to send a donation towards the publication of these materials above, please reach us through any of the contact outlets at the end of this message.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Radio Ministry</h2>
                <p>WTM is also looking out for sponsors to support our radio edition of our INSIGHTS FROM GOD'S WORD BIBLE STUDY PROGRAMME. The programme is designed to last for 60 minutes and will be divided into the following segments: 5 minutes of live inspirational gospel music, 40 minutes of clear Bible study presentation, and 15 minutes for listener questions and contributions. We believe the Lord will be using this radio ministry to bless millions of hearts in Africa and beyond. Each edition of the programme will be uploaded on our website so people who are not able to tune in locally or from the internet can still access and follow the radio broadcasts wherever they are in the world. Keep watching out for information on this segment of our ministry. Every year, we will be paying about $8,000 for 52 appearances on air. If the Lord is speaking to your heart now to support this radio outreach ministry, please do let us hear from you through any of our contact outlets at the end of this message. </p>
                
                <h2>3. WTM Centers of Influence</h2>

                <p>WTM Centres of Influence are Vegetarian Restaurant Centres that we are working hard to establish soon. The goal of these centres is to help influence various hearts for Christ through the Adventist Health Message. We intend to begin with a model centre and then duplicate the same service to several other places later on in the future. The main resources we need to start up the first model centre will cost about $ 4,000 (this cost includes purchase of a facility that will serve the needs of restaurant space, conference hall, and offices. This cost also includes start-up materials / equipment for the restaurant. If the Lord is touching your heart to support or invest in this segment of our ministry, you can call any of our contact outlets at the end of this message. </p>

                <h2>4. Resources for Our Social Media Ministry</h2>

                <p>It is the vision of White Throne Ministries to reach 1 billion people with the everlasting gospel and the three angels' messages by 2027 through various Social Media Platforms. As you can see, this is a huge goal. But we are confident that through the grace of Christ and your sacrificial giving we can exceed this target. Our operation REACH 1 BILLION within the next 10 years has inspired us to begin recruiting 1,000 committed social media anchors who will be sharing our devotions and Bible studies to various groups and individuals on Social Media Networks such as WhatsApp, Email, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Google +.</p>
                <p>To be able to reach this vision, we need portable devices such as robust smartphones that can support the work. If you have been blessed through our articles, devotions and Bible studies, we encourage you to prayerfully consider donating 100 dollars or more towards this endeavour. You may also donate any smartphone in kind to us through our mail address. Any phone you donate will assist a WTM Social Media Anchor to reach over a 1,000 people daily with our Bible studies, articles and devotions that are touching many hearts for Jesus across the world. </p>
